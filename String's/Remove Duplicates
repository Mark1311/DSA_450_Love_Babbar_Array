Questions:- Given a string s without spaces, the task is to remove all duplicate characters from it, keeping only the first occurrence.

Note: The original order of characters must be kept the same. 

Solution:- 

def removeDups(self, str):
	    sets = set()
	    res = []
	    for i in str:
	        if i not in sets:
	            sets.add(i)
	            res.append(i)
	    return "".join(res)
