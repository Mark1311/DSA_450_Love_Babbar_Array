Questions:- Implement strstr

Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns an integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

Note: You are not allowed to use inbuilt function.

Example 1:

Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = Fr

-1

def strstr(s,x):
    #code here
    if x in s:
        return s.index(x)
    return -1
