Qestion:- Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Solution:- 
def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n:
            n &= (n-1)
            count = count+1
        return count
